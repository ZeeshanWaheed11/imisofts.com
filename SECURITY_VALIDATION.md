# Security Headers Validation Guide

## What Was Implemented

✅ **_headers file created** - Contains all security headers for Cloudflare Pages
✅ **Content Security Policy** - Prevents XSS attacks while allowing your existing inline styles
✅ **Clickjacking Protection** - X-Frame-Options: DENY prevents embedding in frames  
✅ **MIME Type Protection** - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff prevents MIME attacks
✅ **HTTPS Enforcement** - Strict-Transport-Security forces secure connections
✅ **Privacy Protection** - Referrer-Policy limits information leakage

## How to Validate (After Deployment)

### 1. Test Security Headers
Visit: https://securityheaders.com/
- Enter your website URL
- Should show **A+ rating** after deployment

### 2. Test Content Security Policy  
Visit: https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/
- Enter your website URL
- Verify CSP is working without blocking content

### 3. Browser Developer Tools
1. Open your website
2. Press F12 → Network tab → Reload page
3. Click on main document → Headers tab
4. Verify these headers appear:
   - `x-frame-options: DENY`
   - `x-content-type-options: nosniff` 
   - `content-security-policy: default-src 'self'...`

### 4. Test Form Functionality
- Fill out contact form on homepage
- Verify it still submits to Formspree successfully
- No console errors should appear

## Next Steps
1. Commit _headers file to your Git repository
2. Push to GitHub (triggers Cloudflare deployment)  
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
4. Run validation tests above
5. Apply same headers to all other pages if successful

## Compatibility Confirmed
✅ Google Fonts will continue working
✅ Formspree forms will continue working  
✅ Inline CSS/JS will continue working
✅ SVG favicon will continue working
